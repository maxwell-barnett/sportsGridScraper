#Web Scraper for NFL Immaculate Grid

##sportsGridScraper:
Uses BeautifulSoup4 and requests packages to scrape pro-football-reference.com for players that have played for the teams that the user inputs.

For example, the top three players listed that have played for both the Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons would be:
1. Calais Campbell
2. John Abraham
3. Chris Chandler

This order is determined by Pro Football Reference's frivolties page where the players are ranked by total AV (Approximate Value)
